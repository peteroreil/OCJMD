Log of all decisions, assumptions, reasoning behind design decisions
====================================================================
1.	Created a Subcontractor class to be used as a transfer object - Value Object Design Pattern
	For ease of transferring a record or data. Also allows for how params should be set, see point below
	on setting customer ID.
	
2. 	List<String> chosen for specialites, list size will be unknown size.

3. 	Subcontractor Constructor does not take the id of the customer as a param. Assuming that 
	if a Subcontractor is being created that there will be no customer to be assigned immediately.
	
4.	The Database Schema specifies and 8 digit number for the customer ID. It is assumed that this
	digit has to be exactly 8 Digits. Setter method setCustomerId throws and IllegalArgumentException
	in event that param is < or > 8 digits.	
	
5.	The setEmployeeCount will throw IllegalArgumentException in event there is less than 0 passed as
	an argument. Does not make sense that an subcontractor can have negative number employees.
